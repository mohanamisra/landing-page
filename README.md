# landing-page

This project was to create a dummy landing page, so as to practise creating web pages from scratch, designing them with CSS and planning their layout with Flexbox. It was really rewarding to be able to finish this page (and getting it to look exactly how I was supposed to).

Build Status - Complete (Dummy)

Tech/Framework Used - HTML, CSS (layout with Flexbox)
